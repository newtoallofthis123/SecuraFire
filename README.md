You can automatically get a firefox optimized for privacy and security
Firefox 85 which is i guess the latest version of Firefox let's you create and use different user profiles. This an excellent feature and I use it as a part of my browser isolation program, but it is a very difficult and time consuming to configure the profile for privacy and security everytime I create a new one.
Hence I created The most secure form and config of Firefox 85 and made sure you all can have access to it. There is a guide included within the executable that you should be able to run with a standard file compression program like 7zip / WinRAR
All th einstructions are given within the Article. Also I plan of releasing a Video soon.
Feed back is welcome. I hope to make my coding skills good enough to make a executable file. :)
